[Kung fu sample]
Shaolin shadowboxing, and the Wu-Tang sword style
If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang
could be dangerous
Do you think your Wu-Tang sword can defeat me?
	En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style


[Chorus: RZA]
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus
Bring da motherf.., bring da motherfuckin' ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus

[Ghostface Killah]
Ghostface, Catch the blast of a hype verse
My glock bursts, leave in a hearse, I did worse
I come rough, tough like an elephant tusk
Your head rush, fly like Egyptian musk
Aw shit, Wu-Tang Clan spark the wicks an'
however, I master the trick just like Nixon,
causin' terror, quick damage your whole era
Hardrocks is locked the fuck up, or found shot
P.L.O. style, hazardous cause I wreck this dangerous
I blow sparks like Waco, Texas

[Raekwon]
I watch my back like I'm locked down
Hardcore hittin' sound, watch me act bugged and tear it down
A literate type asshole, songs goin' gold, no doubt
and you watch a corny nigga fold
Yeah, they fake and all that
carryin' gats but yo, my Clan's rollin' like forty Macs
Now your act convinced, I guess it makes sense
Wu-Tang, yo suuuuuuuuu, represent
I wait for one to act up
Now I got him backed up
Gun to his neck now, react, what?
And that's one in the chamber
Wu-Tang banger, 36 styles of danger

[Chorus]

[Inspectah Deck]
I rip it hardcore like porno-flick bitches
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits
Check it, my method on the microphone's bangin'
Wu-Tang slang, I'll leave your headpiece hangin'
Bust this, I'm kickin' like Segall Out For Justice
The roughness, yes, the rudeness, ruckus
Redrum, I verbally assault with the tongue
Murder-one - my style shot your knot like a stun-gun
I'm hectic, I wreck it with the quickness,
set it on the microphone, and competition get blown
by this nasty-ass nigga with my nigga - the RZA,
charged like a bull and got pull like a trigga
So bad stabbin' up the pad with the vocab, crab
I scream on your ass like your dad: "bring it on..."

[Chorus]

[GZA]
Yo, I'm more rugged than slaveman boots
New recruits, I'm fuckin' up MC troops
I break loops and trample shit while I stomp!
A mudhole in that ass, cause I'm straight out the swamp,
creepin' up on site, now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fuckin' dangerous
and more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Choppin' through your back, *swish*
givin' by-standers heart-attacks
Niggas try to flip, tell me who is him?
I blow up his fuckin' prism,
make it a vicious act of terrorism
You wanna bring it, so fuck it
Come on and bring the ruckus
And I provoke niggaz to kick buckets
I'm wettin' cream, I ain't wettin' fame
Who's sellin' gain I'm givin' out a deadly game
It's not the Russian, it's the Wu-Tang crushin' roulette
Slip up and get fucked like Suzette
Bring da fuckin' ruckus...

[Chorus]

So bring it on...(X7) 

punk nigga!
