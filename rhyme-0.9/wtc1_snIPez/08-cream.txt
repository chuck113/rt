[Raekwon]
I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Staying alive was no jive
At second hands, moms bounced on old man
so then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo, rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I begin to G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this, son, rollin' with this one
and that one, pullin' out gats for fun,
but it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend,
started smokin' woolies at sixteen
and running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes,
making my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off, and try to get the dough all,
sticking up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like weather
Figured out I went the wrong route
so I got with a sick-ass click and went all out
Catchin' keys from across seas,
rollin' in MPV's, every week we made forty G's
Yo nigga - respect mine, or anger the Tec 9
Ch-chick-POW! Move from the gate now

[Chorus: Method Man]
Cash Rules Everything Around Me
Cream
Get the money
Dollar, dollar bill y'all

[Inspectah Deck]
It's been twenty-two long hard years of still strugglin'
Survival got me buggin', but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
and stay awake to the ways of the world, cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make cream
which failed, I went to jail at the age of 15
A young buck sellin' drugs and such who never had much,
trying to get a clutch at what I could not touch (could not touch)
The court played me short, now I face incarceration,
pacin' - going upstate's my destination,
Handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty, shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turns I learned life is hell,
living in the world no different from a cell
Everyday I escape from jakes givin' chase,
sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke cess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
but I'm still depressed, and I ask what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth
who explained: "working hard may help you maintain
to learn to overcome the heartaches and pain"
We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
and stray shots - all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be living proof
to kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's running wild, smokin' cess, drinkin' beer
and ain't trying to hear what I'm kickin' in his ear
Neglected, but now, but yo, it gots to be accepted,
that what? that life is hectic

Chorus 4X

[Outro: Inspectah Deck]
Niggas gots to do what they gotta do to get a bill,
yaknowhatI'msayin'?
cause we can't just get by, no more
Word up, we gotta get over, straight up and down

Chorus 3X

[Method Man]
