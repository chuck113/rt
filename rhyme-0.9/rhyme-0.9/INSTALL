                     Rhyming Dictionary Installation
                     *******************************

The Rhyming Dictionary is a C program that uses GDBM to find the
rhymes of any english word you give it.  In order to install it,
you'll need to have GDBM (the GNU Database Manager) installed on your
system.  If you don't have GDBM, you can get it from:

http://www.gnu.org/software/gdbm/gdbm.html

You will also need GNU Readline, available at:

http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html

Please note that MySQL is *no longer required!*  In fact, MySQL is no
longer used whatsoever.  At the end of this file are instructions on
how to clean out the old rhyme data from your MySQL databases if
you're upgrading from a previous version.



* Step 1: Edit the Makefile

Change BINPATH to where you'd like the "rhyme" binary installed
(the default is /usr/bin) and change the RHYMEPATH to where you'd like
the Rhyming Dictionary database files installed (the default is
/usr/share/rhyme).  These database files will be about 10 megabytes,
so make sure you have enough room.  Also included is a man page, so
feel free to adjust the MANPATH to where you would like it installed
(the default is /usr/share/man/man1).


* Step 2: Build it

Type "make".  You'll notice that a "compile" binary is created first.
This program generates GDBM files from the included text files and
will take quite awhile to complete.  Why?  Because GDBM files aren't
actually cross-platform.  For example, Sun Sparc GDBM files don't work
on Linux x86 and vice-versa.  The compile step ensures that the
created GDBM files *will* work on your machine.  The actual building
of the "rhyme" binary should be quite simple.


* Step 3: Install it

As an administrator, type "make install".  This will place the "rhyme"
binary in the BINPATH directory and the "words.db","rhymes.db" and
"multiple.db" files in the RHYMEPATH directory.  If you'd like to move
these files at any time, you can use the RHYMEPATH environment
variable to point "rhyme" to the new location.


And you should be all set!  As long as the BINPATH is in your path
(most likely), you should be able to type "rhyme" and get the words
you're looking for.  The performance of GDBM is similar to that of
the old MySQL version but with only half the steps to install.


If you find you don't like or need the dictionary any longer,
"make uninstall" will remove its files from your system so long as
they haven't moved since installation.  By design, the install
doesn't spray files all over your system.  So cleanup or upgrading
should pose no problems.

* Uninstalling old MySQL data

As promised, if you're upgrading from an older version you most likely
have unneeded rhyme data sitting in MySQL.  To remove it, first
connect to MySQL as an administrator.  Try:

mysql -u root -p

at a UNIX prompt and give it the proper MySQL root password.  If
successful, you should see something like:


Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 51 to server version: 3.22.32

Type 'help' for help.

mysql>


which indicates you are now connected.  At the mysql> prompt, you can
now type:

drop database rhymedict;

and the data should be removed.  But there's probably still a guest
user present on MySQL which should also be removed.  Do this by
typing:

delete from mysql.user where User="rhymeguest" and Host="localhost";

and the guest user should be removed.  That's it!  Just type "quit;"
to exit MySQL and don't look back.  Future versions of the Rhyming
Dictionary will no longer use MySQL to store rhyming data.  If you
have no other use for MySQL, feel free to remove it from your system
entirely.
