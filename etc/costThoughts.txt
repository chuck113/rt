The aim is to return rhymes that are satisfying. This will be made up of: recognised artists, good/funny lines,
short to read. Different audiences will have different opinions on offence etc, swearing should be configurable and
set to medium to begin with (no f or c!).

The predictive/suggestive input is important - people could miss-spell, can give people other ideas and give indication of what
is in the database.

Most important: recognised artists

Artists should be configurable as this will determine weather people like the app! What is the best way to do this?
- list of artists - too long
- year/era? decades? useful but can't distinguish between pop/underground
- pop/underground useful but how? could apply pop rating to artist based on songs in charts. But just because an
artist has had some pop hits, doesn't mean they're pop, ie nas
- Favorites system - too much work from user, user may not do properly, more work. Could allow a user to select favourite
artists from a list and base results on those?

Whatever ever is implemented we need a sensible default which will be more pop-ish using songs and albums that have
been in the US and UK top 40 in the last 15 years - I should choose what they are, use the dsl rating systems.

Shorter rhymes better? less to read.
Popularity as guaged by something. Could use recent charts with update but just stick to record sales - if we ever find them
big words and more than two word rhymes

Only give 2-3 answers in one go to make them more 'valuable', if users see lots of results they may become less valuble?

-- simple rating system --
will be primitive listing artists we'd like to see in results. 1 is popular 5 is not so. Doing this on an album basis
is a blunt instrument and we'd rather do it on singles
