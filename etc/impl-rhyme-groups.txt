May benefit from groups of rhymes - groups of words that rhyme with each other. useful for giving back better
random results as we'll know the next result didn't rhyme with the last. may make searching easier as we can just
store groups of rhmes mapped on to each entry with the rap lines associated with a rhyme group.

May be good for iphone indexing, we zip up a group with each rhyme and de-index when user searches.
In GAE a RhymeGroup would contain all the lines that rhyme with a word. Would only be good for large groups, will
have to see how big they are.

* Need to be careful that we dont drop too many words - 

words(val word:String, ref RhymeGroup)
RhymeGroup(val )

Rhyme groups would be built after the hierarchal index is being built up, will be quite easy to do. This data would
then be used by deployments for random data
